### GitOps

Honestly, there's too many ways to do gitOps, and it's kind of overwhelming. Weave Flux is the most mature, so just start there.

If you pay WeaveWorks for Flux, everything is pretty magical, but if you have $0, then start with https://github.com/justinbarrick/flux-operator and https://github.com/justinbarrick/fluxcloud which do an ok job.
When you get to secrets, use https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets

If you like helm, then maybe consider https://github.com/giantswarm/chart-operator or https://github.com/stefanprodan/gitops-helm

Oh, I did remember this training too: https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/blob/master/site/helm-get-started.md
